#Sulfur

Sulfur, it's above Selenium

##What is it?

Sulfur was created to test highly dynamic web applications while at the same time bring better structure and clarity to your testing. 

It has built in support for all major WebDriver drivers (Android, Chrome, FireFox, HtmlUnit, Internet Explorer, iPhone, Opera, PhantomJS, Safari, and more). You just tell Sulfur the what and where of the browsers you want and it will do the rest.

Use Sulfur's baked in support for page objects to define the structure and behavior of your web application for more consise tests.

Looking to run your tests locally but have them execute remotely and distributed? No problem. Sulfur has full support for the Selenium Grid.

Have some old Selenium unit tests, or worse, Selenese HTML tests? No problem. Sulfur can execute those as well. It can even execute them using WebDriver for true browser testing.
